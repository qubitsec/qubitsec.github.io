    Find page object from a given URL string and create a link to that page.
    
    Warning: You probably want to use the `link` tag in Jekyll as that enforces a required
    path and that the path is valid. But, maybe this includes file can be extended
    to work across repos (i.e. domains) like for linking from Dev Resources to Dev Cheatsheets
    for a given URL or the page's current URL or path.

    Required param:
        url: A page's path on the domain. e.g. "/cheatsheets/python/".

    Some sample data, for context on this includes file:
        "name": "index.md",
        "path": "cheatsheets/python/index.md",
        "dir": "/cheatsheets/python/", # Gives too many matches - you have to then filter by filenames too.
        "url": "/cheatsheets/python/" # This is unique, so we only get one page matching.
