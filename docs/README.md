## About

This project is a fork of the Minima theme, adjusted to handle SVG logos of programming tools and to handle menus for nested directories.

Using the nesting approach here, a site can have directories nested any number of levels down if they have an `index.md` file at each to serve as a navigation list of pages and directories available. No Jekyll collections are needed.

Because of this recursive nested structure, this project has been named "Fractal".

Here is a definition:

> In mathematics, a fractal is a self-similar subset of Euclidean space whose fractal dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension. Fractals appear the same at different levels, as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)


## Purpose

I found myself writing the same modifications on top of the Minima theme across my projects, so I made my own theme to put everything in one place.

I use this theme in my Jekyll sites where I collect and write content around coding. 

See these links for a demo of how this theme works in one of those sites, have over 100 pages and a few nesting levels.
